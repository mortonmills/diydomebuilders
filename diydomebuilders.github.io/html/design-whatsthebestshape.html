Why domes?
</p>

<br>
My first thought about geodesic domes.
<br>
There are many different ways to define best.
And in this article we are going to explore what shapes, excel at what.
<br>
When it comes to building a structure, you are going to come across shapes.
Costs play a large factor in building so building a structure that you get more for less is ideal.
So the first category we are going to look at it is covering the most space for the least amount of material.
<br>
Before we dive into the 3D world, let's first take a look into 2D to help us better understand.
<br>

<h2>Best 2D Shapes</h2>

<div class="textContent">
First up are the regular polygons.

Perimeter: <input oninput="truthMe()" id="perimeter" type="number" value="10"  style="width: 60px">
<br>

<div id="group2D1" >texthere</div>



<script>

    let group2D1 = document.getElementById("group2D1")

    let tableHeader = [
      "Place",
      "Picture",
      "Name",
      "Area",
    ]

  let shape = [
    "circle",
    "hexagon",
    "pentagon",
    "square",
    "triangle",
  ]

    let tableMade = tableArrayMaker(tableHeader,shape)
    let tableFinal = tableMaker(tableMade)

    group2D1.innerHTML = tableFinal

</script>


<script>

fixedPoint = 2
let circle = document.getElementById("circle")
let hexagon = document.getElementById("hexagon")
let pentagon = document.getElementById("pentagon")
let square = document.getElementById("square")
let triangle = document.getElementById("triangle")



function truthMe(){
let side = 0
let area = 0
let perimeter = document.getElementById("perimeter").value

circle.value = circleArea(perimeter)
hexagon.value = hexagonArea(perimeter)
pentagon.value = pentagonArea(perimeter)
square.value = squareArea(perimeter)
triangle.value = triangleArea(perimeter)

}

truthMe() //show initial value
</script>

<div class="textContent">
For closed shapes the circle reigns king as being the most efficient for covering space with the least amount of material.
<br>
<br>
Our next group are "open" shapes. In the 2D world we are imagining that we already have a side available to us as the ground.
So we can have a minimum of 2 sides and the 3rd would be the ground.

    let group2D2 = document.getElementById("group2D2")

The circle is the most efficient closed 2D shape.
<br>
The arch is the most efficient open 2D shape.
<br>
So which shapes have the lowest perimeter to area (see calculator here).
