<h2>About/Contact</h2>

My encounter with geodesic domes began with the hopes of building an offgrid home.

Not sure how to build a roof, I discovered geodesic domes could make that possible.
<br>
After embarking on the project, I had a lot of questions that needed some research.
<br>
Once finished, I wanted to share that research as an easy-to-use and ad-free website.
<br>
I had also found a lot of other interesting projects while researching geodesic domes.
<br>
This inspired the name of the site and have a devoted catalog for domebuilders called 
<a href="../library/diydomebuilders.html">diydomebuilders+</a>
<br>
