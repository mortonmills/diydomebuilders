table of contents
-
GROUP 1 - regular polygons 3 to 6 sides and circle
GROUP 2 - regular polygons sideless shapes
GROUP 3 - quartered or side divisions and or vertex divisions

GROUP 1
equilateral triangle
side = perimeter/3 
area = side² * √3 / 4

square
side = perimeter/4 
area = side²

pentagon 
side = perimeter/5 
area = side² / 4 * √(25 + 10 * √5)

hexagon
side = perimeter/6
area = 3/2 * √3 * side²

circle
radius = circumference / (pi x 2) 
area = π r²


GROUP 2 sideless shapes 
equilateral triangle 2 sides
side = (perimeter(3/2))/3 . 
area = side² * √3 / 4

square 3 sides
side = (perimeter(4/3))/4 
area = side²

square 2 sides 90 degrees isosceles right triangle
side = perimeter/(2+√2)
area = side² / 2

pentagon 4 sides
side = (perimeter(5/4))/5 
area = side² / 4 * √(25 + 10 * √5)

petnagon 3 sides quadrilateral
pentagon 2 sides calculcate angle 72o to get triangular area

hexagon 5 sides
side = (perimeter(6/5))/6
area = 3/2 * √3 * side²

hexagon 4 sides penta
hexagon 3 sides quad is trapezoid
hexagon 2 sides tri

circular segments


GROUP 3 half and quartered or side divisions and or vertex divisions
equilateral triangle
cutting in half by would yield in another equilateral triangle. The bottom half is regular trapezoid also applicable to hexagon vertex division.
cutting in half by vertex is a right triangle.

rectangle 
perimeter/6 = side. 
area = side * (side*2)

1/4 and 3/4 square

pentagon = this answer is beyond the scope of the article but you can find more information here.
The bottom half?
vertex and side division.
vertex is find

hexagon
two versions trapezoid.
from vertex and from center of side
perimeter/5 = side
unequalside = side * 2
height = 1/2*Math.sqrt(4*b*b-(a-b)*(a-b));
area = ( unequalside + side ) / 2 * height

semi-circle 
perimeter/(Math.PI-(-2) = radius. 
area = π r

radius = perimeter/Math.PI
area = radius*radius*Math.PI/2
