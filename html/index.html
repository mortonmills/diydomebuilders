Welcome to diydomebuilders,
<br>
This site was put together in hopes of making the domebuilding experience an easy one.
<br>
Geodesic domes make for some very strong and durable structures, and their biggest advantage, I believe, is an easy to build roof.
<br>

<br>
There are many routes you can take to building a dome and the site is here to help walk you through them.
<br>
The site is divided into 5 sections
<ul>
  <li>The <b>Library</b> section has information about the history of the site and catalogs of other sources for domebuilding.<br>
If you check out the diydomebuilders+ catalog, you might find some inspiration from other domebuilder's experiences.</li>
  
  
  <li>The <b>Design</b> section explains the <b>theory</b> behind geodesic domes.</li>

  <li>The <b>Build</b> section explains the <b>practical</b> side of domebuilding.</li>

  <li>The <b>Offgrid</b> section is to help make the most of your geodesic dome.<br> Most important in this section, is safely preparing for potential disasters that could happen.</li>

  <li>And lastly, the <b>Calculators</b> section contains the recipes for your domebuilding.
<br>The calculators on this site were made to calculate all the things you need to know.
 <br> Down to pipe length, bolt/nut count, weight of dome, and so forth.
<br>One thing I want to stress, is that if you are investing some money into your domebuilding project, 
then I highly recommend double (or even triple) checking the calculations manually.
  </li>
</ul>
<br>

Enjoy!
